MEMO FROM: Melvin Cronf, Assistant VP, Product Development
</p><p>
TO: New Invention Exploitation Committee
</p><p>
DATE: April 5, 1984
</p><p>
SUBJECT: Amazing new invention
</p><p>
Today I received a letter from Fred Funk, an inventor in Minneapolis.
He's come up with the most astounding device and I think we should
go with it.  What do you folks think?

      The Operation of the Xanadu
Hypertext System
             [current implementation
8/1982]
</p><p>
Retrieval of Text and Topology
</p><p>
     The basic function of the Xanadu
hypertext system is the  storage,
maintenance,and  retrieval  of
arbitrarily large amounts of textual
and relational information.
</p><p>
     The Xanadu hypertext system can
be thought of as a  mass  of  text
with no inherent order in itself.
With the mechanisms of documents and
links, any arbitrary topology can be
imposed on the data that the  system
contains.  The order that the user
sees is imposed by the document.
Text, link ids, and document ids are
retrieved with:
</p><p>
                - RETRIEVEV
</p><p>
 The topology can be examined with
the topology retrieval operations:
</p><p>
</p><p>
                - RETRIEVEDOCVSPAN
                - RETRIEVEDOCVSPANSET
</p><p>
</p><p>
     It is useful when  dealing  with
a  document  to  know  how  much
material  is  involved.  In the case
of a very small document, a front-
end may want to retrieve all of the
text at  once,  where  in  a  large
document, only small pieces will be
retrieved at any one time.  This is
one use for the topological retrieval
operations.
</p><p>
RETRIEVEV &lt;spec set&gt;
     This retrieves the document ids,
text,  and  link  ids  that  are
specified by the request.  The
information is returned in an order
that corresponds to the order of the
spec set, not in the order of the
system  addresses.  This request can
be used to retrieve the actual
information that a link points to by
using a link id in the place of a
document  id  in the spec.  This
would be following the link, but in a
more direct fashion than with the
FOLLOWLINK request.  RETRIEVEV will
not be useful  for  following  links
when  the  topology  of  the  link is
of interest.  For instance, to
retrieve the text that the to-set of
a link points  to, the span in the
spec would have a stream address of
2.1 and a width of 1.
</p><p>
RETRIEVEDOCVSPAN &lt;doc id&gt;
</p><p>
     This returns the span of the
document.  This span is the extent of
the  entire  document, with both the
text and the links included.  This
means that if there are no links in
the document, the width of the span
will  be  the number of characters in
the document.      Otherwise, the
width of the span will indicate the
number of links in the document.
</p><p>
RETRIEVEDOCVSPANSET &lt;doc id&gt; * The
current implementation of this
request is incomplete.
</p><p>
</p><p>
     This request is supposed to
return two spans:  the span of all
the document's  text,  and the span
of all the documents links. If there
is no text or no links in the
document only one span will be
returned.
</p><p>
Creation of Documents and Versions of
Documents
</p><p>
Definitions:
</p><p>
 [1]  documents
</p><p>
          A document is a user
created entity  that  contains  text
or
          other  byte  information
and/or links.  A document is divided
          into two distinct regions;
a text space and a link space.
</p><p>
[2]  versions
</p><p>
          Versions are created from
previously existing documents  with
          the  CREATENEWVERSION
request.  A version is created when
you
          want to preserve and intact
copy of a  document  as  is,  and
          have  another copy to edit.
A new editing incarnation is NOT
          a new version.  The Xanadu
hypertext definition of this  term
          is very specific.  A
version is a document, the only
distinction being that a version  is
descended  from  a  previously
          existing document.  A new
version inherits all of its immediate
ancestor's information, both textual
and topological.
</p><p>
     The Xanadu hypertext system has
the following  functions  for  the
creation of documents and versions of
documents:
</p><p>
                - CREATEDOCUMENT
                - CREATENEWVERSION
</p><p>
</p><p>
     A front-end program may let the
user create documents or  versions
implicitly, explicitly, or both,
depending on the particular
front-end.
</p><p>
CREATENEWDOCUMENT
</p><p>
       This request creates a new
document under the account  and  node
of  the  user  who  issued the
request.  The document id is the
tumbler address of the new document.
It will be appended to the account of
the user  who  created  it.   For
example,  if the user's last document
is 17.0.23.0.15, the new document
will be 17.0.23.0.16.
</p><p>
CREATENEWVERSION &lt;doc id&gt;
</p><p>
      This request creates a new
version  of  document  &lt;doc  id&gt;  and
returns  the  id of the new version.
The new document will have a tumbler
address which indicates that the new
document  is  descended  from the
original.   For  example, if there is
only one version of document
23.0.17.0.256,  this  request  will
create  a  document  with  the  id
23.0.17.0.256.1.  Let's describe a
more complicated case.  Say that for
document 23.0.17.0.256, the versions
</p><p>
                23.0.17.0.256,
                23.0.17.0.256.1,
                23.0.17.0.256.1.1,
                23.0.17.0.256.1.2,
                23.0.17.0.256.2,
            and 23.0.17.0.256.3
</p><p>
exist.  Now, if a new version of
23.0.17.0.256.2 was  to  be  made,
it would  have  the id
23.0.17.0.256.2.1.  This will have no
effect on any existing version,
23.0.17.0.256.3 will still be the
same  document  at the same address
as before.  The new document will
inherit ALL information that was
associated with  the  original,  but
be  treated  as  an independent
document, existing simultaneously
with the original or any other
versions.
</p><p>
Comparison of Documents and Versions
of Documents
</p><p>
       The Xanadu hypertext system
has the following functions for  the
comparison of documents and versions
of documents:
</p><p>
                -
SHOWRELATIONOF2VERSIONS
                - FINDDOCSCONTAINING
<<<<<<< master:htdocs/1.olddemo/demo_docs/Feidoc.html
</p><p>
 SHOWRELATIONOF2VERSIONS &lt;spec set&gt;
&lt;spec set&gt;
</p><p>
</p><p>
       This request returns a list of
ordered pairs of all parts of the two
spec sets that correspond to the same
original source.
</p><p>
FINDDOCSCONTAINING &lt;spec set&gt;
</p><p>
       This request returns the ids
of all documents that  contain  the
same material as specified by &lt;spec
set&gt;.
</p><p>
Editing of Text in Documents
</p><p>
       The Xanadu hypertext system
has the following operations for the
editing of text:
</p><p>
                - INSERT
                - DELETEVSPAN
                - REARRANGE
                - COPY
                - APPEND
</p><p>
 INSERT &lt;doc id&gt; &lt;v-address&gt; &lt;text&gt;
</p><p>

       This request inserts &lt;text&gt; at
&lt;v-address&gt; in document &lt;doc id&gt;.
</p><p>
DELETE &lt;doc id&gt; &lt;v-span&gt;
</p><p>

       This request removes the
v-span from the document &lt;doc id&gt;.
</p><p>
REARRANGE &lt;doc id&gt; &lt;cut set&gt;
</p><p>
</p><p>
       The &lt;cut set&gt; consists of two
to  four  v-addresses  within  the
specified  document.  A two cut
rearrange will simply delete
everything between the cuts.  A three
or four cut  rearrange  transposes
the  two regions  of  text.   With
three cuts, the two regions are from
cut 1 to cut 2, and from cut 2 to cut
3, assuming cut 1 &lt; cut 2 &lt; cut  3.
With four  cuts,  the regions are
from cut 1 to cut 2, and from cut 3
to cut 4, here assuming cut 1 &lt; cut 2
and cut 3 &lt; cut 4.
</p><p>
COPY &lt;spec set&gt; &lt;doc id&gt; &lt;v-address&gt;
</p><p>
</p><p>
       Copy causes all of the
information specified by &lt;spec set&gt;
to be virtually inserted at
&lt;v-address&gt; in document &lt;doc id&gt;.
</p><p>
APPEND &lt;doc id&gt; &lt;text&gt;
</p><p>

     Append inserts &lt;text&gt; after the
last character  in  document  &lt;doc
id&gt;.
</p><p>
Links:  Use, Content, Creation and
Retrieval
</p><p>
       There is one operation for the
creation of links.
</p><p>
                - MAKELINK
</p><p>
</p><p>
       The Xanadu  hypertext  system
has  these  operations  that  are
involved in the retrieval of links:
</p><p>
                - FOLLOWLINK
                -
FINDNUMOFLINKSFROMTO
                - FINDLINKSFROMTO
                -
FINDNEXTNLINKSFROMTO
                - RETRIEVEENDSETS
</p><p>
 Link restrictions
</p><p>
    There are three types of
restriction presently implemented:
</p><p>
                From-set restriction
                To-set restriction
                Home document
restriction
</p><p>
</p><p>
     A three-set restriction will be
added once link types  are
implemented.   The  fro  m-set,
to-set, and three-set restrictions
are spec-sets.  The home document
restriction is a set of  doc-ranges.
A  link retrieval  operation  will
only return those links that meet all
of the criteria set by the
restriction.
</p><p>
MAKELINK &lt;home doc&gt; &lt;end sets&gt;
</p><p>
</p><p>
     This request creates a link with
the specified end-sets  in  document
&lt;home  doc&gt;.   The new link will be
appended to the link space of
document &lt;home doc&gt;.  For example if
&lt;home doc&gt; is 1.0.2.0.3,  and  the
last   link   in   it   is
1.0.2.0.3.0.2.15,  the  new  link
will  be 1.0.2.0.3.0.2.16.
</p><p>
FOLLOWLINK &lt;link id&gt; &lt;which end&gt;
</p><p>
</p><p>
     This request returns a spec-set
that is the end of link &lt;link  id&gt;
specified &lt;which end&gt; to be used
later by such requests as RETRIEVEV.
</p><p>
FINDNUMOFLINKSFROMTO &lt;restriction
set&gt;
</p><p>
</p><p>
     This request returns the number
of links that fall within the
restriction set.
</p><p>
FINDLINKSFROMTO &lt;restriction set&gt;
</p><p>
</p><p>
     This request returns the ids of
all the links that fall within the
restriction set.
</p><p>
FINDNEXTNLINKSFROMTO &lt;restriction
set&gt; &lt;link id&gt; &lt;n links&gt;
</p><p>
</p><p>
     This request returns the ids of
the next n links after link  &lt;link
id&gt; that fall within the restriction
set.
</p><p>
RETRIEVEENDSETS &lt;spec set&gt;
</p><p>
</p><p>
     This request returns a spec set
of all the from-sets  and  a  spec
set of all the to-sets that fall
within &lt;spec set&gt;.

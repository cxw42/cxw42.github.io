NAME
     conti - Chip's oozing continent pretty-picture program
</p><p>
SYNOPSIS
     conti [ itcnt [ dispcnt [ seed ]]]
</p><p>
DESCRIPTION
     Conti is an oozing continent pretty-picture program for the Ann Arbor
     Terminals "Ambassador" (60 line display)
</p><p>
     "itcnt" is an iteration count.  It tells how many passes of the algorithm
     to perform between displays (default 1).
</p><p>
     "dispcnt" is a display count.  It tells how many times to display a
     screenful of stuff (default 1).
</p><p>
     "seed" is a random number seed (default is taken from the low bits of
     the current time).
</p><p>
     This program generates pretty oozing continental patterns according to
     the following algorithm:  starting with a screenful of random black and
     white blocks, pick coordinates at random and span them outward in a
     Von Neuman window (up, down, left and right but not diagonally).  Repeat
     many times.
</p><p>
FILES
     It really wants to send its output to a terminal and not to a file.
</p><p>
BUGS
     It doesn't know when it has reached a stable state.

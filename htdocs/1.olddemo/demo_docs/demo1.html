Dear Mr. Cronf,
</p><p>
Our firm has, over the past two weeks, developed the most amazing new
gadget that ever there was.  After hours of tedious effort, it is now
ready to be unleashed on the world.  Would your company be interested
in a joint venture to produce and market this remarkable invention?  We,
of course, would provide the invention.  Your organization would
provide the sales and production expertise and especially the money.
How about it guys?                
</p><p>
                                        Cordially,
                                        Fred Funk

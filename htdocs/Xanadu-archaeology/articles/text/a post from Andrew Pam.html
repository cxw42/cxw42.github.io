Where are the specs if I've got to construct the tools myself?

The Hypermedia Server documentation (for the '88 server) is very useful, and there is an article in the September 1994 Dr. Dobbs that describes the Ent, the once-proprietary tree structure originally discovered by the Xanadu team in the 1970s. Ents are ideal for log-based filesystems.

I'm sorry but maybe my frustrations are starting to show.

I feel that way myself sometimes.

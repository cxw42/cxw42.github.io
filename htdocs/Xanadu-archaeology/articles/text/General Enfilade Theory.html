(See the page <a href="EnfiladeTheory.html">EnfiladeTheory</a> which is more of a tutorial on enfilades, and then covers some of the same material as this page, from that point of view.)
</p><p>
Enfilades are a form of data structure, useful in several areas of the Xanadu software. They have two basic properties which can be independently tweaked:
</p><p>
    * WIDativity (upwardly-propagating attributes -- width)
    * <a href="DSPativity.html">DSPativity</a> (downwardly-propagating attributes -- displacement)
</p><p>
An example of WIDativity is the WID field of the Model T enfilade.
</p><p>
The fundamental "model-T" enfilade appears to be a balanced tree of totally ordered content addresses. The simplest approach to managing such a data structure for multiple versions, with data sharing, is to use a technique that I've always called "copy-to-root". The udanax code instead inserted some sort of node representing a permutation or alteration in place at every ancestor where the child relations change for a given version. I believe that these "node-level diffs" are called "orgls", but can't quite tell.
</p><p>
The loaf/crum management is a basic explicitly managed virtual memory, with in memeory use-counts managed in the code. Link management is based on a "2-D" enfilade which seems to manage starting points and widths of linked areas, with linked lists of pointers to the original data in the I-stream.
</p><p>
Example: in computer graphics, a WIDative property (upwardly cumulative) is the bounding box, which grows as the tree included becomes larger.
</p><p>
A <a href="DSPative.html">DSPative</a> property is matrix rotation, such as that of a finger of a hand on an arm, where the movement of a single bone of a single digit is a matrix product of all the motions farther up the tree.
</p><p>
What was the <a href="DSPative.html">DSPative</a> property in the Model T? It was the sequencing of the pointers, which sequenced the text below in a tree of downward imposition.
</p><p>
Both WIDative and <a href="DSPative.html">DSPative</a> properties must be associative, i.e. for such a property p
</p><p>
"A p (B p C) = (A p B) p C"
</p><p>
because there is no telling how the next version will be edited.
</p><p>
However, WIDative properties must be associative horizontally (like the sum of the WIDs in the Model T enfilade) and <a href="DSPative.html">DSPative</a> properties must be associative vertically (like the positions of the crums in the Model T enfilade).
</p><p>
<a href="General Enfilade Theory.html">General Enfilade Theory</a> permits the creation of custom enfilades by the suitable selection and design of WIDative? and <a href="DSPative.html">DSPative</a> properties.

A data structure that manages huge agglomerates of text and their arrangement in and out of memory. It handles the revision of serial data very quickly and very cleanly.

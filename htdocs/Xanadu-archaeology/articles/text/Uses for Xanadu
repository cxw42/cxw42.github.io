If Xanadu sprung fully functional into existence today, what would it be used for? Where would you start?

If I had a Xanadu account, I would...

   1. start loading common reference documents into Xanadu and linking them into directories. Maybe start with the Gutenberg Project.
   2. upload my graduate thesis, hoping it will be cited in future Xanadu activity.
   3. Three words: Google Usenet Archive.
   4. Get as many version of the Christian Bible online as possible.
   5. Load my email...all of it back to 1984. (See Intertwingle)
   6. Load the various preprint and other paper archives (like citeseer)
   7. Congressional Record and Hansard...linked to the political contribution records.
   8. The Zapruder film...and all of the commentary I could find.

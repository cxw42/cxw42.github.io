While <a href="OTrees.html">OTrees</a> are some form of enfilade, the <a href="HTrees.html">HTrees</a> are whatever it takes to keep track of the diverging O-planes; they are not enfilades. In essence it it the reverse of the OTree, mapping from document contents to document editions.

The name HTree derives from their use in tracking the revision history of a document.

In a number of the pages on this site they're referred to as being coloured blue in various diagrams.

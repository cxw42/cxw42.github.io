About Tree Data Structures
</p><p>
- trees versus hashes (we need range operations, which are lacking in hashes)
</p><p>
- most trees are organzized along one dimension of search
</p><p>
(TBD: add lots of links to background material on wikipedia et. al.)
</p><p>
Operations
</p><p>
Dynamic set operations, in time proportional to the height of the tree.
</p><p>
    * search
    * predecessor
    * successor
    * minimum
    * maximum
    * insert
    * delete 
</p><p>
Balanced versus Unbalanced
</p><p>
A balanced tree has a height "log n" where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The objective of balancing is to minimize the number of levels in the tree in order to obtain the best running time.
</p><p>
Types of Trees
</p><p>
binary-tree?
    has at most two child nodes per node 
red-black?
    ??? 
AVL
    ??? 
b-tree
    has more than two child nodes per node 
quad?
    ??? 
K-dimensional?
    ??? 
</p><p>
Caching
</p><p>
Large trees often cannot all be held in primary storage (RAM) at one time. Instead a virtualization of storage, by combining an in-memory cache with secondary storage is used in these cases. Optimizing the number of nodes becomes more important with splitting storage across primary and secondary.

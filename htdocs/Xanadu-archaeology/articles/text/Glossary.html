  Xanadu is a client-server architecture, where the client, called a *Front-End*, provides the user-interface, and the server, called a *Back-End*, serves the data.  The link between the two is via an 8-bit clean link using either a TCP socket or a Unix named pipe.

The Back-End can be divided up into a database of links, a sieving/searching engine and a database of text.

The text database, or datastore, is conceptual a separate piece with a well-defined interface. Planning ahead, the datastore could be a DVD server with active data migration and/or a <A HREF="http://freenet.sourceforge.net">Freenet</A> node that circulates public data globally. In fact, the Freenet concept can provide the BE-to-BE data migration that Nelson talks about, moving frequently accessed data closer to the client.

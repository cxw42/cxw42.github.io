I found this possibly illuminating note in one of the old email archives.

It may shed some light on the meaning of the term "orgl" in the Green code. Of course, it may not, if the term Orgl had drifted by the time of tech equivalence noted here.

I've seldom seen a terminology discussion that resulted in a useful new name. In most cases, you do much better to pick a slightly sub-optimal but conventional word than to invent one of your own. Some past examples from Xanadu: Bert -> Work, Grab -> Lock, Orgl -> Edition. I'd rather not see this trend reversed.

Just MHO. Thanks for listening.

(PS: If you must have a terminology discussion, I suppose you've earned it... as long as you make the April milestone! :-)

----------

"Orgl" comes from "ORGanizational? eLement" and was indeed renamed to "Edition".

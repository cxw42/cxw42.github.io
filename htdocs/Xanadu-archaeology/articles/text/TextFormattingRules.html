Your text is formatted as a web page according to some simple markup rules. These are intended to be convenient and unobtrusive.
</p><p>
The <a href="StructuredTextRules.html">StructuredTextRules</a> are used by default. Briefly -
</p><p>
    * separate paragraphs with a blank line
    * a single-line paragraph followed by a more-indented paragraph makes a heading
    * for bulleted/numbered lists, use * or 0. followed by a space
    * for emphasis, use ... and ...
</p><p>
Also -
</p><p>
    * WikiName(s), bare urls and words enclosed in square brackets are converted to hyperlinks (prepend the link or the line with ! to prevent this)
    * HTML &amp; DTML tags may be used
</p><p>

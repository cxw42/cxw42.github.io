See <a href="EnfiladeTheory.html">EnfiladeTheory</a> for a hint. <a href="DSPative.html">DSPative</a> is the correct spelling, not "DSPatibility?" as it appears there.

(Sorry, there may have been a page called "<a href="General Enfilade Theory.html">General Enfilade Theory</a>" that had "DSPatibility?" in it, but the link here was broken and I can't find such a page. In the <a href="EnfiladeTheory.html">EnfiladeTheory</a> page DSPs? are called "disps," and <a href="DSPative.html">DSPative</a> is spelled dispative, my bads. --SteveWitham? )

Knuth's list  (Page 235 of "The Art of Computer Programming", Volume 1
                (Fundamental Algorithms)
Operations you want to be able to perform on linear lists:
</p><p>
i) Gain access to the kth node of the list to examine and/or to change the contents of its fields. 
ii) Insert a new node just before the kth node. 
iii) Delete the kth node. 
iv) Combine two or more linear lists into a single list. 
v) Split a linear list into two or more lists. 
vi) Make a copy of a linear list. 
vii) Determine the number of nodes in a list. 
viii) Sort the nodes of the list into ascending order based on certain fields of the nodes. 
ix) Search the list for the occurence of a node with a particular value in some field.

Our corresponding list Operations you want to be able to perform on collections of keyed information:
</p><p>
. i) Access the element at a given position. . ii) insert a new element at a given position. . iii) Delete an element at a given position. . iv) Combine two collections. . v) split a collection into two. . vi) make a (virtual) copy of a collection. vii) determine the size of a collection. viii) sort the collection by a particular field A) by a common field that you're willing to keep up-to-date. B) by a field that you won't use often enough to keep up-to-date. ix) search for an item for with a particular value in some field.
</p><p>
PLUS A. keep history, compare versions B. link information together C. provide access control D. resolve contention (allow multiple users to work and not conflict)

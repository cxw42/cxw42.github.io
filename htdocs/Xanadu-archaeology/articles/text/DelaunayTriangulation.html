A blank piece of paper is a terrible thing to waste...

And the meaning of DelaunayTriangulation escapes me - What is it?

Interesting that Voronoi and Delaunay are duals....

Delaunay Triangulation

The Delaunay triangulation is a triangulation which is equivalent to the nerve of the cells in a Voronoi diagram, i.e., that triangulation of the convex hull of the points in the diagram in which every circumcircle of a triangle is an empty circle (Okabe et al. 1992, p. 94). The Mathematica command PlanarGraphPlot?pts? in the Mathematica add-on package DiscreteMath?`ComputationalGeometry?` (which can be loaded with the command <

The Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagram in r2 are dual to each other.

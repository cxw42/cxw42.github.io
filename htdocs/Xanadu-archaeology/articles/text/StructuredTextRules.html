"Structured text is text that uses indentation and simple symbology to indicate the structure of a document.

A structured string consists of a sequence of paragraphs separated by one or more blank lines. Each paragraph has a level which is defined as the minimum indentation of the paragraph. A paragraph is a sub-paragraph of another paragraph if the other paragraph is the last preceding paragraph that has a lower level.

Special symbology is used to indicate special constructs:

    * A single-line paragraph whose immediately succeeding paragraphs are lower level is treated as a header.
    * A paragraph that begins with a '-', *, or o is treated as an unordered list (bullet) element.
    * A paragraph that begins with a sequence of digits followed by a white-space character is treated as an ordered list element.
    * A paragraph that begins with a sequence of sequences, where each sequence is a sequence of digits or a sequence of letters followed by a period, is treated as an ordered list element.
    * A paragraph with a first line that contains some text, followed by some white-space and -- is treated as a descriptive list element. The leading text is treated as the element title.
    * Sub-paragraphs of a paragraph that ends in the word example or the word examples, or :: is treated as example code and is output as is:

          <table border=0>
            <tr>
              <td> Foo 
          </table>

    * Text enclosed single quotes (with white-space to the left of the first quote and whitespace or puctuation to the right of the second quote) is treated as example code.

      For example: &lt;dtml-var foo>.

    * Text surrounded by ' characters (with white-space to the left of the first and whitespace or puctuation to the right of the second ') is emphasized*.
    * Text surrounded by ' characters (with white-space to the left of the first and whitespace or puctuation to the right of the second ') is made strong**.
    * Text surrounded by _ underscore characters (with whitespace to the left and whitespace or punctuation to the right) is made underlined.
    * Text encloded by double quotes followed by a colon, a URL, and concluded by punctuation plus white space, or just white space, is treated as a hyper link.

      For example, &quot;Zope&quot;:http://www.zope.org/ is interpreted as Zope

      Note: This works for relative as well as absolute URLs?.

    * Text enclosed by double quotes followed by a comma, one or more spaces, an absolute URL and concluded by punctuation plus white space, or just white space, is treated as a hyper link.

      For example: &quot;mail me&quot;, mailto:amos@digicool.com is interpreted as mail me

    * Text enclosed in brackets which consists only of letters, digits, underscores and dashes is treated as hyper links within the document.

      For example: "As demonstrated by Smith &#091;12&#093; this technique ..."

      Is interpreted as: "As demonstrated by Smith [12] this technique"

      Together with the next rule this allows easy coding of references or end notes.

    * Text enclosed in brackets which is preceded by the start of a line, two periods and a space is treated as a named link. For example:

      .. &#091;12&#093; "Effective Techniques" Smith, Joe ...

      Is interpreted as

[12] "Effective Techniques" Smith, Joe ...

Note: see the <A NAME="12"> in the HTML source.

Together with the previous rule this allows easy coding of references or end notes."

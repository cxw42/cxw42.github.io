Whiteboard: OTrees    	  last revised by 127.0.0.1 on Aug 17, 2005 3:31 am     	
		

OTrees are enfilades, whereas HTrees are not. Their roots are document editions and their leaves are the document contents.

The name OTree derives from their use in tracking the organization structure of a document. An OTree is sometimes referred to as an ORGL.

In a number of the pages on this site they're referred to as being coloured red in various diagrams.

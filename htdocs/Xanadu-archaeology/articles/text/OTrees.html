<a href="OTrees.html">OTrees</a> are enfilades, whereas <a href="HTrees.html">HTrees</a> are not. Their roots are document editions and their leaves are the document contents.

The name OTree derives from their use in tracking the organization structure of a document. An OTree is sometimes referred to as an ORGL.

In a number of the pages on this site they're referred to as being coloured red in various diagrams.

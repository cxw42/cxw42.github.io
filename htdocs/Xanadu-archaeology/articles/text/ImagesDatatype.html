I believe it is going to be hard to apply xanalogical principles to images; the slicing and rearrangement operations common in text don't map well to two-dimensional, variable color-palette, infinite data formats.
</p><p>
Nonetheless, the following manipulations are needed for images:
</p><p>
   1.
</p><p>
      extraction/reference of thumbnail mini-images
</p><p>
      <a href="the question.html">the question</a> is, if they are prepared in advance, at which sizes? and if not prepared in advance, computing them in advance would burden the server.
</p><p>
   2.
</p><p>
      extraction/reference of a section of an image
   3.
</p><p>
      combining of multiple images into one, e.g. for geographic maps.
</p><p>
Perhaps if we standardized on a lossless format (PNG) and a lossy one (JPEG) we could make it work, but I'm sure that won't please many people.
</p><p>
Hmmm, is there any research into segmenting/encoding of images, into fractal quadrants that might give us the ability to easily grab portions or scaled up/down pieces?

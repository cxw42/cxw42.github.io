Huh? You know, "log-like!" It means that the amount of computer time (or storage space) used by some operation is proportional to the log of some measure of the thing it's working on. So, say, if some enfilade algorithm made virtual copies of chunks of text and it performed like this:

bytes of text    milliseconds to make virtual copy
     1,000           1
    10,000           2
   100,000           3
 1,000,000           4
etc.

...then that would be a "log-like" operation (actually the time for most operations in a ModelT enfilade depends on the log of the size of the whole text represented by the enfilade, not the size of the piece being changed.).

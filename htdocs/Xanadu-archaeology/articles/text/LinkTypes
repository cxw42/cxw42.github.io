In the Udanax Green design (and presumably in the Gold design as well) links are used to indicate all of the formatting instead of inline markup. The link type tumbler(s) of a link indicates how the link should be interpreted by the front-end. Unfortunately assigning functionality to link types was never formally done except in the most superficial way.

If we are going to build real interoperable xanalogical systems using the Udanax design, we are going to need to come up with a basic set of link type identifiers for both linking and formatting. Udanax Green's documentation has the following set predefined"

Link Type 	Tumbler 	Comment
jump 	1.1.0.1.0.2.0.2.1 	From Udanax Green
quote 	1.1.0.1.0.2.0.2.2 	From Udanax Green
footnote 	1.1.0.1.0.2.0.2.3 	From Udanax Green
marginal note 	1.1.0.1.0.2.0.2.4 	From Udanax Green

This is the list of proposed link types listed in [LM 93.1] on pages 4/52 to 4/55:

Link Type 	Tumbler 	Comment
Title 	not determined 	Metalinks
Author 	not determined 	Metalinks

Vanilla Jump 	not determined 	Hypertext

Alt-Version 	not determined 	Literary Link
Comment-Doc 	not determined 	Literary Link
Certification 	not determined 	Literary Link
Mail 	not determined 	Literary Link

Formatting, layout and typography issues are glossed over, however it is clear to me (JohnDougan) that making a reasonable set of formatting links is important for initial acceptance.

Initially I propose that we use a basic formatting that corresponds roughly to the functionality found in wiki's and in HTML without CSS or frames. At the very least basic text transformation should be provided:

Link Type 	Tumbler 	Comment
Italics 	not determined 	Proposed
Boldface 	not determined 	Proposed
Underline 	not determined 	Proposed
Text-Size 	not determined 	Proposed
Paragraph 	not determined 	Proposed
Heading 	not determined 	Proposed

Later we could expand the basic set to the point where the CSS level of rendering functionality.

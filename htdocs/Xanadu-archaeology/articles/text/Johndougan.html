Got interested in Xanadu when I got a copy of CL/DM around 1981 or so. Between that, and early exposure to Smalltalk it has warped my view of computing completely. Now I'm hacking Smalltalk for a company, Visual Knowledge Software, that has built a semantic database on which I can edit for use as an application development platform.

Udanax Assigned Numbers Authority (UANA)
</p><p>
One of the crowning successes of the early Internet was the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) run by Jon Postel. I think emulating this for the Udanax system would be a profitable action.
</p><p>
UANA should be responsible for registering and disseminating tumbler line assignments, link types, host mapping, and anything else along these lines.
</p><p>
    * <a href="LinkTypes.html">LinkTypes</a> 
</p><p>
Proposal: Reserved digit. The first digit in the tumbler after the ur-digit is reserved for the use of UANA.
</p><p>
    * 1 - Global link types
    * 2 -
    * 3 - DNS encoding host ID
    * 4 - localhost

Udanax Assigned Numbers Authority (UANA)

One of the crowning successes of the early Internet was the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) run by Jon Postel. I think emulating this for the Udanax system would be a profitable action.

UANA should be responsible for registering and disseminating tumbler line assignments, link types, host mapping, and anything else along these lines.

    * LinkTypes 

Proposal: Reserved digit. The first digit in the tumbler after the ur-digit is reserved for the use of UANA.

    * 1 - Global link types
    * 2 -
    * 3 - DNS encoding host ID
    * 4 - localhost

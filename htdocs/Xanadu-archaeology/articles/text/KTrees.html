Over the years various people discovered structures like the enfilade, usually just for specific purposes. Rodney Bates published an article about a 1-D enfilade in the September 1994 Dr. Dobb's:

K-TREE CONTAINER DATA STRUCTURES

by Rodney Bates

K-trees are container data structures that represent linear sequences of integers, pointers, and the like. Although Rodney initially developed K-trees to deal with the problem of browsing and debugging incomplete programs, they also have a more general applicability.
A copy of the above article is (was?) at http://www.acm.org/pubs/articles/journals/drdobbs/1994/9409/9409b/9409b.htm

Here's Dr. Dobb's' own page showing the abstract (I know they sell most of their back-issue collection on a single CD, but they don't seem to be offering the individual article off their web site):

The K-Tree is different from the k-d tree. See KDTrees.

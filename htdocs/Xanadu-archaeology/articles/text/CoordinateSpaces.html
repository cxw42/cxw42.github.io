          o CoordinateSpace? """A coordinate space represents (among other things) the domain space of a table. Corresponding to each coordinate space will be a set of objects of the following kinds:

            Position
                The elements of the coordinate space.
            Mapping
                (Add a description.)
            OrderSpec?
                The ways of specifying partial orders of this coordinate space's Positions.
            XuRegion?
                An XuRegion? represents a set of Positions. The domain of a table is an XuRegion?.

            When defining a new coordinate space class, one generally defines new corresponding subclasses of each of the above classes. A kind of any of the above classes knows what coordinate space it is a part of (the "coordinateSpace()" message will yield an appropriate kind of CoordinateSpace?). CoordinateSpace? objects exist mostly just to represent this commonality. Coordinate spaces are disjoint -- it is an error to use any of the generic protocol of any of the above classes if the objects in question are of two different coordinate spaces.

            For example, "dsp->of (pos)" is not an error iff "dsp->coordinateSpace()->isEqual(pos->coordinateSpace())".

            Note that this class is not COPY or even PSEUDO_COPY. All of the instance variables for CoordinateSpace? are basically cached quantities that require vary little actual state from the derived classes in order to be constructed. This realization allows a knot to be untangled when reading these objects from external storage."""
                + BasicSpace? """BasicSpace? versus CoordinateSpace? is not a type distinction in that there is no difference in contract with the client. BasicSpace? exists as a convenience to the definer of new CoordinateSpaces. A new subclass of CoordinateSpace? should be a subclass of BasicSpace? iff there is only one coordinateSpace that corresponds to the new class, i.e. that the instances are not parameterized to yield different coordinate spaces. BasicSpace? provides some conveniences (especially in Smalltalk) for defining a single canonical instance at dynamic initialization time, and always using it.

                  As this class is irrelevant to CoordinateSpace? clients, but useful to those defining other kinds of coordinate spaces, it is an excellent example of something that would be classified as a "protected" class -- something to be pursued if we try to make modules more like classes."""

Identity of a Heaper is determined according to its response to "isEqual" and "hashForEqual" (see "The Equality of Decisions" for a bunch of surprising issues regarding Heaper equality). A region is a HeaperSpace? is a SetRegion? (see SetRegion?). As a result of having HeaperSpaces?, one can use the identity of Heapers to index into hash tables, and still obey the convention that a table maps from positions in some coordinate space.

                  HeaperSpaces? cannot (yet?) be used as the domain space for Xanadu Stamps, and therefore also not as the domain space of an IndexedWaldo?. In order to do this, the Heapers in question would have to persist in a way that Xanadu doesn't provide for.

                  As is typical for an unordered space, the only Dsp for this space is the identity Dsp. No type or pseudo-constructor is exported however -- the Dsp is gotten by converting a HeaperSpace? to a Dsp. Similarly, no heaper-specific type or pseudo-constructor is exported for my regions.

          o Mapping """A mapping is a general mapping from one coordinate space to another, with few of the guarantees provided by Dsps. In particular, the source and destination coordinate spaces can be different, and the mapping doesn't have to be everywhere defined (but it has to say where it is defined via "domain" and "range" messages). A mapping doesn't have to be unique -- the same domain position may map to multiple range positions and vice versa. A mapping of a XuRegion? must yield another XuRegion?, but a mapping of a simple region doesn't have to yield a simple region.

            A useful and valid way to think of a Mapping is as a (possibly infinite) set of pairs (a mathematical set, not a ScruSet?). The domain region consists of the first elements of each pair, and the range region consists of the second elements.

            A mapping is most useful as a representation of a version comparison of two different organizations of common elements. The mapping would tell how positions in one organization correspond to positions in the other."""

                + FilterPosition?
                + IntegerPos? """Because of the constraints of C++, we have two very different types representing integers in our system.

                  XuInteger? is the boxed representation which must be used in any context which only knows that it is dealing with a Position. XuInteger? is a Heaper with all that implies. Specifically, one can take advantage of all the advantages of polymorphism (leading to uses by code that only knows it is dealing with a Position), but at the cost of representing each value by a heap allocated object to which pointers are passed. Such a representation is referred to as "boxed" because the pointer combined with the storage structure overhead of maintaining a heap allocated object constitutes a "box" between the user of the data (the guy holding onto the pointer), and the actual data (which is inside the Heaper).

                  In contrast, IntegerVar? is the efficient, unboxed representation of an integer. (actually, it is only unboxed so long as it fits within some size limit such as 32 bits. Those IntegerVars? that exceed this limit pay their own boxing cost to store their representation on the heap. This need not concern us here.) See "The Var vs Heaper distinction" and IntegerVar?. When we know that we are dealing specifically with an integer, we`d like to be able to stick with IntegerVars? without having to convert them to XuIntegers?. However, we`d like to be able to do everything that we could normally do if we had an XuInteger?.

                  For this purpose, many messages (such as Position Dsp::of(Position)) have an additional overloading (IntegerVar? Dsp::of(IntegerVar?)) whose semantics is defined in terms of converting the argument to an XuInteger?, applying the original operation, and converting the result (which is asserted to be an XuInteger?) back to an IntegerVar?. Dsp even provides a default implementation to do exactly that. However, if we actually rely on this default implementation then we are defeating the whole purpose of avoiding boxing overhead. Instead, IntegerDsp? overrides thnt implementation.

                  Any particular case may at the moment simply be relying on the default. The point is to get interfaces defined early which allow efficiency tuning to proceed in a modular fashion later. Should any particular reliance on the default actually prove to be an efficiency issue, we will deal with it then."""

          o XnRegion? """The design of a new coordinate space consists mostly of the design of the XuRegions? which can be used to describe (possibly infinite) sets of positions in that coordinate space. It will generally not be the case (for a given coordinate space) that all mathematically describable sets of positions will be representable by an XuRegion? in that space. This should not be seen as a temporary deficiency of the current implementation of a space, but rather part of the design of what a given space means.

            For example, in IntegerSpace?, one cannot form the XuRegion? whose members are exactly the even numbers. If this were possible, other desirable properties which are part of the intent of IntegerSpaces? would no longer be possible. For example, any XuRegion? should be able to break itself up into a finite number of simple XuRegions? ("simple" is described below). Were an even number region possible, this would have undesirable consequences for the definition of "simple" in this space. If you want (for example) to be able to have a XuRegion? which can represent all the even numbers, it probably makes more sense to define a whole new space in which these new XuRegions? apply.

            XuRegions? should be closed under a large set of operations, such as intersection, unionWith, complement and minus. ("closed" means that the result of performing this operation on XuRegions? of a given space is another valid XuRegion? in the same space.) Additional guarantees are documented with each operationn? may be classified at one of three levels of "simplicity":

            1) The simplest are the distinctions. Distinctions are those that answer with (at most) a single set containing themselves in response to the message "distinctions". (The reason I say "at most" is that a full region (one that covers the entire coordinate space) may answer with the empty set.) Distinctions are the simplest XuRegions? of a given space out of which all other XuRegions? of that space can be finitely composed. There should probably be a message "isDistinction" for which exactly the distinctions answer "true". The complement of a distinction is a distinction. Three examples of distinctions in spaces are:

            a) in IntegerSpace?, any simple inequality. For example, all integers < 37. b) in one kind of 3-space, any half space (all the space on one side of some plane) c) in another kind of 3-space, any sphere or spherical hole.

            Note that "c" could not just have spheres as the distinction because distinctions must be closed under complement. (We are here ignoring the quite substantial problems that arise in dealing with approximate (e.g., floating point) which would almost necessarily have to arise in doing any decent 3-space. 3-space is nevertheless a good intuition pump.)

            2) Next are the simple regions. Simple regions are exactly those that say "true" to "isSimple". All distinctions are also simple regions. In response to the message "distinctions", and simple region must return a finite set of distinctions which, when intersected together, yield the original simple region. Generally, one tries to define the simple regions for a space to correspond to some notion of locality in the space. For example, it may be good for a simple region not to be able to have a hole in it. Or perhaps a simple region is which must be connected (whatever that means in a given space). Example non-distinction simple regions for the above example spaces would be:

            a) The interval from 3 inclusive to 17 exclusive (intersection of all integers >= 3 and all < 17) b) A convex hull (intersection of half spaces) c) Whatever you get by intersecting a bunch of spheres a           The simple regions for both "a" and "b" would be connected, without holes, and even convex. This follows directly from the definition of our distinctions. None of these nice properties holds for "c", and this also follows directly from our decision to start with spheres. "c" is still perfectly valid, just less preferable by some criteria.

            3) Finally, there are the regions of a space in general. Any region must respond to the message "simpleRegions" with a stepper which will produce a finite number of simple regions that, when unioned together, yields the original region. A simple region will return a stepper that will return at most itself ("at most" because an empty region (which covers no positions) may return an empty stepper). Example non-simple regions are:

            a) all integers < 3 and all integers >= 17 b) two convex hulls c) two disjoint spheres

            Note that "a" is the complement of the earlier "a" example, thereby showing why the complement of a simple region isn`t necessarily simple. Even though the "c" space is so unconstrained in the properties of its simple regions, there is no way to interect a finite number of spheres and spherical holes to produce a pair of disjoint spheres. Therefore the pair is non-simple. Not all spaces must have non-simple regions (or even non-distinctions). It is interesting to observe for "b" and "c" that even though there is a natural conversion between their respective positions, (except for the empty and full regions) there is no conversion at all between their respective regions. The kinds of sets of positions representable in one space is completely different than those representable in the other space.

            We will use these three example spaces repeatedly in documenting the protocol."""

          o CrossRegion? """A cross region is a distinction if 1) it is empty, 2) it is full, or 3) it is the rectangular cross of full regions and one distinction. Note that case 3 actually subsumes 1 and 2. Since the simple regions of a space are the intersections of a finite number of distinctions of a space, this implies that A cross region is simple if it is the rectangula. In other words, a simple region is identical to the cross of its projections."""

                + GenericCrossRegion? """Represents a region as a two-dimensional array of crosses of subregions. Was NOT.A.TYPE but that obstructed compilation. I think this might work better if the array is lexically sorted, but I am not sure there is any meaningful way to do so. Thus there is no sorting assumed in the algorithms, although the protocol may occasionally suggest that there might be.

                  Eventually this implementation may save space by using NULL to represent repetitions of a sub region such that fetchBoxProjection (box, dim) == NULL only if box > 0 && boxProjection(box, dim)->isEqual(boxProjection (box - 1, dim)) && (dim == 0 || fetchBoxProjection(box, dim - 1) == NULL)."""

                      # Filter """A position in a FilterSpace? is a region in the baseSpace, and a filter is a set of regions in the baseSpace. It is often more useful to think of a Filter as a Boolean function whose input is a region in the baseSpace, and of unions, intersections, and complements of filters as ORs?, ANDs?, and NOTs? of functions. Not all possible such functions can be represented as Filters, since there is an uncountable infinity of them for any non-finite CoordinateSpace?. There are representations for some basic filters, and any filters resulting from a finite sequence of unions, intersections, and complements among them. The basic filters are:

                        subsetFilter(cs,R)
                            all subsets of R (i.e. all R1 such that R1->isSubsetOf(R)) supersetFilter(cs,R) -- all supersets of R (i.e. all R1 such that R->isSubsetOf(R1))

                                    SetRegion? is our answer to that. To start with, a set region can simply be an enumeration of the positions which are its members.

                                    1) empty region 2) full region 3) singleton set (single member) 4) singleton hole (single non-member) 5) region with more than 1, but a finite number, of members 6) region with more than 1, but a finite number, of non-members

                                    Cases 1, 3, and 5 can be considered the "positive" regions, and cases 2, 4, and 6 the "negative" ones.

                                    Because we only have distinctions (which we are currently doing for an internal reason which will probably go away), we forego the ability to use the generic XuRegion? protocol to decompose complex ones. Instead we provide SetRegion? specific protocol ("positions" and "isComplement").

                                    At a later time, we will probably have cases 1 thru 4 above be the only distinctions, case 6 be a simple region but not a distinction, and have case 5 be a non-simple region. (These choices are all consistent with the letter and spirit of the simplicity framework documented in XuRegion?. Simple regions must be the intersection of distinctions, therefore case 5 cannot be a simple non-distinction.) Please try to write your software so that it'll be insensitive to this change. Thanks.

                                    SetRegion? is an abstract superclass useful for defining regions for spaces which have the constraints listed above."""
